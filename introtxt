Welcome to Mexico City
Mexico City is home to a lake called “Lake Xochimilco”
This lake is the last remaining natural habitat of the Axolotl
It is your task to capture and raise these Axolotls, protecting them from extinction
Quick there’s one now!

Now that you have your first Axolotl, you need to give them a name

Watch out!  a large fish is coming
You need to protect [name] from predators
Scare off the larger fish by clicking on them

Oh no, your Axolotl was damaged
But don’t fear, Axolotls possess the ability to regenerate
They are able to fully regrow their limbs

To speed up the recovery process you need to provide food for the axolotl
But first let's dance with [name] to cheer them up

Great, now that [name] is happy again, lets go get them some food

Collect the worms before they get away

Now we have enough worms to feed [name]
Let's go give them their food

Press “e” to open your inventory
Now press on the worm
And click on [name] to feed them

Wonderful! [name]s arm has now grown back
I will leave you to it now, try to rescue as many axolotls as possible, without letting any die

Press “m” to access the menu
From here you can: collect worms, go fishing, and go to the store
